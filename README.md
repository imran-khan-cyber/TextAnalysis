- **Special Character Exclusion:** The analysis ignores special characters.
- **Histogram Display:** Visualizes the character counts in a histogram pattern.
- **Multiple Input Methods:** The tool can be tested using various data inputs:
    * Automatic sample data.
    * User-entered text.
    * Content read from a file.
